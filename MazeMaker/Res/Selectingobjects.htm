			<a href="Home.htm">Home</a> &gt; Selecting Objects
			<br />
			<br />
The most basic way to select an object is by clicking on it in "Pointer" mode. When selecting floors or End Regions, clicking the mouse will select all of that typeof object under the mouse. For example, if two floor regions overlap, by clicking on the overlapping region, both will be selected at once. This does not apply to a combination of floors and End Regions.<br /><br />
To more precisely select objects, and to select multiple objects of various types, hold the "Control" key while clicking. Clicking while holding "Control" will now cause additional objects to be selected or deselected. You can use this method to deselect objects when many overlap, leaving the desired selection.
			<br />
			<br>
			In cases where many objects overlap in a small space, the mouse becomes less helpful. You can switch between objects using the Ctrl+Space key combination. One object must be selected first.
			<br>
			<br>
			Additionally, the "Left Pane" or "List" contains a listing of every single object in the maze, sorted by type. 
			If &quot;Left Pane&quot; is not visible, click &quot;View&gt;Left Pane&quot; at the top 
			menu when a maze is open.
			<br><br>
			Clicking an entry in this list will select the object it refers to. Clicking "Floors" will select all the floors, "Walls" will select all walls, and so on. The pane can be accessed under the "View" menu or by clicking "List" in the toolbar.
		</P>
		<br>
		To deselect all objects, click on a vacant section of the Maze Editor while in "Pointer" mode, or select a different tool.
