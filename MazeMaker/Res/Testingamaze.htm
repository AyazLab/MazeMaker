			<br />
			<br />
The "Quick Run" feature allows you to test the maze you are working on, by opening the MazeWalker application. This feature can be found in the toolbar or under the "Tools" menu.<br /><br />
To configure the "Quick Run", find "Configuration" under the drop-down menu next to the "Quick Run" button, or under the "Tools" menu. There are fewer configurable options than in the regular MazeWalker application.

			<br />
		</P>
		<P>
		In order to perform a test of the maze, the maze file must be saved. If the maze has never been saved, a save dialog will appear. If the maze has already been saved to file before, it will be saved again in its current form.
