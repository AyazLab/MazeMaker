			<br>
			<br>
			In order to place external objects (or "Models") into a maze, there have to bee objects in the Model Collection available for use. The Model Collection is a collection of objects (created outside of MazeMaker) available for use in the maze. 
		<br><br> To add a model, find the &quot;<em>Model Collection</em>&quot; (under &quot;Collections&quot; 
            toolbar). Then you can add models to the collection<br />
		    from three locations: the Standard Library, the User Library, or the same folder 
            that contains your maze file. If the object file exists somewhere else on the 
            computer, it must be copied into one of these locations.</P>
<P>
			Once objects have been added to the Model Collection, they can be used in the maze.
