Models are 3d objects that can be placed in a maze. There are two types of Models: Static and Dynamic models. 
Static models can be used to create a more realistic environment, along with <a href="Textures.htm">textures</a>. Dynamic models allow for user interaction with the objects, through proximity to that object, or readings from an external sensor.
Models allow the designer to place objects that were created in some other program, such as furniture. MazeSuite allows for optional collision detection with these objects, which can be set in the model's properties.
