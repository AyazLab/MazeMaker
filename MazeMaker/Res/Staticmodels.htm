			<br>
			<br>
			Static Models are simply static objects that were created in another program. To add a Static Object, select the "Static" tool from the toolbar, and click in the Maze Editor to place an object there. Afterward, you must give it a Model for it to represent. When the Static Model is assigned a model from <a href=modelcollection.htm>The model collection</a>, an "S" will appear in the circle representing the Static Model in the Maze Editor, to show that it has been assigned a model. There must be items in <a href=modelcollection.htm>The model collection</a> in order to use Static or Dynamic Models. 
			<br><br>
			Aside from choosing a Model for the object to represent, these are other options for Static Models. Aside from the ability to precisely move the Static Model, there are also options for its rotation and whether to enable collisions. If "Collision" is set to False, then the user can pass through the object unhindered.
