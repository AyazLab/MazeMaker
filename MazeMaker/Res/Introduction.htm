MazeMaker is part of Maze Suite which is a complete set of tools that enables researchers to perform spatial
and navigational behavior experiments within interactive, easy to create, and extendable (e.g., multiple rooms) 3D environments. 
<br /><br />

Maze Suite can be used to design and edit adapted 3D environments, as well as track subjects' behavioral performance. Maze Suite
consists of three main applications; an editing program to construct maze environments
(<b>MazeMaker</b>), a visualization/rendering module (<b>MazeWalker</b>), and finally an analysis
and mapping tool (<b>MazeViewer</b>). <br /> <br />
