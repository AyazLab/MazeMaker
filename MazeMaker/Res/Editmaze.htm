			<a href="Home.htm">Home</a> &gt; Editing a Maze
			<br />
			<br />
Once an object has been placed, you can edit it in a number of ways. <br>
To select an object, choose the "Pointer" tool, and click on the object. Other ways to select objects are discussed <a href=selectingobjects.htm>here</a>.<br /><br />
Clicking and dragging the mouse can be used to move an object, which is selected as you click. Objects can be nudged more precisely, by using the arrow keys while holding down the "Control" key.
			<br />
			<br>
			Additionally, you can alter the size or location of an object by manually altering its properties, which can be found in the pane to the right of the Maze Editor. "x" is from left to right in the Editor, "z" is from up to down in the Editor, and "y" refers to the vertical axis, the "down" and "up" in the virtual maze. <br>
			Note: Changes to "y" values are not reflected in the Editor, because the Editor displays the map from above. Such changes are only visible while walking the maze.
		</P>
		To change the global properties of the maze, deselect any currently selected object by clicking, in "Pointer" mode, on any blank region of the Maze Editor.
		<br><br>
		Object properties are discussed in greater detail under the help pages specific to certain objects. Most object properties will have a brief explanation on the bottom of the properties pane.
