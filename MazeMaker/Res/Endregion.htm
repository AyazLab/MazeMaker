			<a href="Home.htm">Home</a> &gt; Adding End Regions
			<br />
			<br />
			End Regions define the successful completion of the maze. When the user enters an End Region, the maze disappears. If the maze is in a MazeList (see <a href=mazelistbuilder.htm>MazeListBuilder</a>) then the MazeWalker will proceed to the next item in the Maze List File. The creation of multiple 
			&quot;End Regions&quot; is allowed. Each has a "Return Value" parameter. Initially this property is set to zero, but by assigning different integers to the End Regions, you can track which End Region was reached to complete the maze.
			<br><br>
To create end regions, select the "End Region" tool and click two locations in the Maze Editor pane to define a rectangular zone between them.<br /><br />
Creating and selecting end zones is similar to creating floors.
			<br />
			<br>
			Modifying an End Region alters slightly from altering a Floor object. Defining bounds on the X and Z axes is almost identical to that of floors. However, for the height , instead of directly defining a range of y values, you define the height of the region ("Height" parameter) and where its center lies on the y axis ("Offset" parameter).
