			<br />
			<br />
			Lights are another way (besides <a href="Textures.htm">Textures</a> and <a href="Models.htm">Models</a>) to increase the realism of a maze. Instead of general light, these objects produce light at certain locations. To add a light, select the "Light" tool, and click in the Maze Editor to place a light. 
			
		</P>
		<P>
			<em>Note:</em> You can place a maximum of eight lights.<br><br>
There are two types of lights, determined by the light's "<em>Type</em>" property. "Bulb" functions as a lights source with a fixed location. "Torch" means that the light follows the user around. The 
			location of "Torch" lights is irrelevant because it will always follow the user 
			so it's location will be updated when the maze is executed.
